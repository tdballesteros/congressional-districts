# congressional-districts


# This project's goal is to assess whether simple methods of randomly drawing national congressional districts results in "better" results (this of course being not entirely objective metric). The project seeks to assess randomly-drawn, contiguous districts' racial composition and voting inclination to predict district partisan competitiveness and likely winners. These results can then be compared to the real life district winnders, partisan competitiveness, and racial composition.
